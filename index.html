              <h3>GPA &amp; My University App (Java, Git, Swing/JPanels)</h3>
              <p>
                In a team built a Java desktop application for university students with grade tracking, checklists, a daily planner, 
                and GPA calculations per-course using a syllabus and cumulative. Implemented a secure data layer for storing user information, 
                enabling seamless entry of new assignment marks with automatic recalculation. Applied clean architecture, SOLID principles, 
                and patterns (strategy, dependency injection) for modularity and easy extension. Additionally, organized use cases, controllers, 
                and factories to keep interactions smooth and maintainable.

              <h3>Sokoban (Assembly, RISC-V)</h3>
              <p>
                Built a Sokoban puzzle game in RISC-V assembly driving an 8x8 LED matrix, including character movement, box pushing, 
                and collision detection. Interfaced with a D-pad and switches for input and reset behavior, and programmed robust 
                movement logic for smooth gameplay and accurate visual updates. Added automatic puzzle generation and progress tracking 
                to boost replayability and engagement.

                <p>
                  Developed a 2D puzzle game with movement in all directions and block-pushing mechanics to achieve win-or-lose conditions 
                  and dynamically change the controlled object. Leveraged Python features such as tuples, lists, file I/O, and OOP principles. 
                  Refactored code for readability and performance, added unit tests to ensure game stability, and produced user documentation 
                  to guide players and improve overall experience.

                <p>
                  Conducted an analysis of Canada Census data (2006–2021) by plotting births and immigration trends using ggplot2. 
                  Applied data cleaning with tidyr and dplyr to prepare datasets and used IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) interpolation 
                  for spatially continuous maps of population change. Employed clustering algorithms to reveal distinct population groups 
                  and regional patterns, offering deeper insights into Canada’s demographic dynamics.

                <p>
                  Designed a high-fidelity financial management app prototype, “FiscalFriend,” focused on budgeting, goal setting, and spending insights. 
                  Built interactive flows in Figma including Budget Score breakdowns, Spending Summaries, Goals, and Transaction tracking. 
                  Conducted usability testing with 12 participants, combining quantitative metrics (task completion time, click counts) and qualitative feedback 
                  to evaluate design clarity and effectiveness. Identified navigation issues, budget score confusion, and visual design shortcomings, then iteratively 
                  refined the prototype with clearer layouts, progress indicators, and improved accessibility. Reflected on design lessons and proposed improvements 
                  for future iterations, including enhanced interactivity and visual identity.
